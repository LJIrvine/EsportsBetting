I'd like to make the following comprehensive updates to the TopBetSite project:

Design & Styling:
Change all site branding colors from the current blue to #6C3BAA.

Use Plus Jakarta Sans as the site’s typeface. If that isn’t available, use a visually similar modern sans-serif.

Remove the search bar entirely unless it can be made to work properly.

Add royalty-free images throughout the site (football, horse racing, betting ambiance) to enhance visual appeal — but do not replace bookmaker logos, everything related to a bookmaker needs to have an accurate logo.

Bookmaker Content:
Ensure the logos for all bookmakers are correct and real, not placeholders or generic icons.

Create full bookmaker reviews for the following additional operators (in addition to any that already exist):

BoyleSports

BetMGM

Betano

Virgin Bet

Kwiff

Casumo

Bet442

Betrino

These reviews should be based in reality, written in a trustworthy tone, and not generic fluff. Please don't add random or unfalsifiable statements.

Display each bookmaker's welcome offer, but only use 100% accurate, current offers — no made-up bonuses.

Betting Resources Section:
Each resource link should go to its own fully written-out page:

Betting Strategy Guide – a dedicated, in-depth page explaining long-term betting strategies.

Understanding Odds – full guide on how fractional, decimal, and moneyline odds work.

Betting Tips – don’t provide our own tips, but explain what betting tips are and link to trusted external tipsters (Twitter, Instagram, Tipstrr, etc.).

Horse Racing Guide – keep this, flesh it out with info on types of races, terminology, form reading.

Responsible Gambling – detailed section covering Gamstop, self-exclusion, deposit limits, time-outs, gambling help organizations (like BeGambleAware).

Betting Glossary – comprehensive glossary of betting terms for beginners and intermediates.

Footer Section:
Ensure all footer links go to real, functional pages.

Privacy Policy

About Us

Terms & Conditions

Gambling Commission info

Betting Guide

Odds Guide

Any other links currently shown in the footer — all should be routed to proper, well-written pages.

Once all of the above is handled, feel free to suggest any improvements that would make the site more professional, trustworthy, or SEO-friendly.
